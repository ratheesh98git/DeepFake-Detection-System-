# DeepFake-Detection-System-
Welcome to the DeepFake Detection System repository! This project is designed to detect DeepFake videos using advanced machine learning techniques, including multi-modal detection (analyzing both audio and video), temporal analysis, and explainability through Grad-CAM. 🧠📈

Features 🌟
Multi-Modal Detection 🎤📹:

Utilizes both audio and video data to enhance detection accuracy.
Temporal Analysis ⏳:

Employs LSTM networks to analyze sequences of frames for temporal inconsistencies.
Explainability 🔍:

Provides visual explanations of the detection decisions using Grad-CAM.
Real-Time Detection 🚀:

Capable of performing real-time detection of DeepFake videos.
User Feedback Loop 🔄:

Allows users to provide feedback to continuously improve the model.
